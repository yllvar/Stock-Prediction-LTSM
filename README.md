# Stock-Prediction-LTSM
This project utilizes LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to predict stock prices for four different symbols: Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Google (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN). The LSTM models are trained using historical stock price data fetched from Yahoo Finance and evaluated based on various performance metrics.
